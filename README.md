# Casino Simulator

This is a simple casino simulator using Python and MySQL.
The program won't work for you as the server is local.

You can make your own local MySQL server to try the application.
First you will need the following packages:
```
pip install mysql-connector-python
pip install cryptocode
```

SQL_VARS.py shall include the following variables:
```
USER = "[INSERT USERNAME]"
PASSWORD = "[INSERT PW]"
HOST = "[INSERT IP]"
DATABASE = "[INSERT TabLE NAME]"
```

Crypto_key.py should look like this:
```
KEY = "[INSERT YOUR KEY]"
```
